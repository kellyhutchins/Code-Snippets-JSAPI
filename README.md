# Code Snippets 
Code snippets I created for common bits of JS, TypeScript, HTML and Css I use when building apps with the ArcGIS API for JavaScript. 

For more info on using Visual Studio Code Snippets check out the [VS Doc](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets)


* json.json contains one snippet that creates a default tsconfig file. 
* javascript.json contains two snippets one that adds in a simple require statement with the Map and Map View modules. The second creates a map. 
* html.json contains two snippets one that adds the JSAPI script tag and css. The second is for use in the body and adds a view div. 
* css.json contains one snippet that adds the css for a full page map
* typescript.json contains two snippets the first that creates a new map and the second that creates a new map using a web map.
